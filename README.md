A lot of books, a lot of articles gives you an advice to contribute to open
source software to level-up you programming skills. But what project to choose?
Google Chrome, Firefox, .NET?

I think that you should choice a project that is
  * is interesting to you, so you can do a dogfooding,
  * allows you to sharpen skills of your choice.

The last point is the most difficult to accomplish. So I think this site will
help you to make a right decision, because:
  * we evaulate each open source repository by some amount of factors, which
    allows to esimate how difficult to make a contribution. For example, if
    site has no new commiters for a long time, that means, that possible it
    is hard to a newbie to start working on this project (lack of documentation,
    special skills are required, pull requests are ignored); if repository is
    not using a bug-tracker, that means that you will have to dive deep into a
    project prior to making your first commit, etc.
  * we operate on issue level, not on repository level, because in every
    reporitory it may be easy and difficult issues, that require different
    skills and known languages and so on.

The idea of this site is not revolutionary. Chromium repository has nice tag
good-first-task, to help new commiters to make thers first commit as soon
as posisble.

We hope that some of companies will promote theirs repositories to attract
a lot of motivated, ambitios programmers to thier projects.
